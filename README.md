This is the technical solution to the DASH Technical challenge.

Assumptions Made for this project:

1. The pronumeral/variable being used in the formula field will be strictly named 'input'
2. The solution being sought after is a REAL solution (i.e. not an imaginary or complex number)
3. Only ONE variable will be used (i.e. the formula is NOT multivariable, for example x + y - 10)
4. Goal Seek in the Excel variant allows for a 0.001 degree of tolerance, so exact solutions are NOT expected in many cases.
5. The back-end system and front-end system will run on the same physical machine
6. Given point (4), the moment a solution yields a result within 0.001 of the desired result, the alogrithm will stop despite the maximum amount of iterations permitted.
